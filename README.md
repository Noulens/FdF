# **FDF** - A wireframe visualizer

This is my version of fdf project for school 42. It includes:
- Rotation around x, y and z axis,
- Translation,
- Modification of elevation,
- Linear gradient,
- Zoom in and out,
- Switch from isometric projection to dimetric projection,
- A reset view function.

I used the following documentation:

- Rotation:

    - [Linear algebra](http://www.gandraxa.com/isometric_projection.xml "Linear algebra")

- Linear gradient:

    - [How to rasterize a triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Ztio8cwqM "Rasterize a triangle")

- Isometric projection:

    - [Linear algebra](http://grafika.me/node/82 "Linear algebra")
